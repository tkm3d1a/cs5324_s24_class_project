\subsection{Use Cases}
There are a total of 16 use cases written at this stage in the project. Each team member was assigned 3 use cases to fully analyze. Each of these 12 use cases are written in fully-dressed form and accompanied by System Sequence Diagrams (SSDs) and Operations Contracts (OCs). The remaining 4 use cases are written in casual/brief form.

The assigned use cases are as follows:
